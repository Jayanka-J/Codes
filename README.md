Background subtraction involves isolating moving objects or people in a video stream by
identifying and subtracting the background from each frame.
Thermal imaging captures infrared radiation, allowing
for effective detection of objects in low-light or complete darkness. This capability
significantly extends the usability of computer vision systems in nighttime surveillance,
wildlife monitoring, and search and rescue operations.
